Modeling financial assets

Do not use the 'Meta Asset" Files any longer, as they direct to Delphi's direct model on Heroku cloud, and we do'nt want to be pinging Greg's server all day as we test.

BGC backtesting base code is stored here as a good start to a universal, easy to use backtesting GUI that I will attempt to build and attach to https://www.blockchainglobalfund.com/test to build out the macrodashboard and research center for us.
